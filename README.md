# robot-rafek

A repository with all the code involved in our remotely controlled presence robot for one of our employees. General idea of the project is outlined on [our blog](https://solidbrain.com/2016/12/05/first-robot-worker-joins-solidbrain/). 

We're in the process of preparing the codebase to be published here.
